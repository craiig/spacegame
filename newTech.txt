	-various classes, attributes

forcefields (higgs fields)
	-efficiency basis for housing/structures
	-basis for :
		new construction (no need for materials besides aethetics), 
		different energy sources(fusion confinement)
		initial star drives (temporarily bend spacetime so the ship travels through it quickly)(like a tiny shitty stargate)

quantum shoebox (indirect observation device:box inside a box)(perfect energy storage)(quantum telephone game)
	-small, portable and ubiquitous
	-can store almost any amount of energy in several forms (max energy based on amount of energy pulsed in at creation - no loss, just the initial spike for the fourier series)
	-can be configured to release energy at different rates and forms
	-requires no maintaining energy but can be damaged

	-higher levels can be linked for power transfer over distance
	-even higher levels can become ansibles
	-even higher higher levels can become stargates
